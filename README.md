###My Linux toolbox

### CENTOS scripts!

This is meant to be my own linux toolbox to be used to automate with Ansible later.

I will try to get it to be more complete later on. 

Currently this toolbox has the following scripts

*chmodx.sh runs chmod +x to all scripts in this folder
*chmodnox.sh chmod -x to all scripts in this folder
*build.sh installs build stuff to your computer
*installeR.sh installs R and R-studio
*ambariclint-sh installs ambariclient
*ambariserver.sh installs ambari-server
*nodeglobal.sh installs node.js globally
*repositories.sh installs repositories
*sshkeys.sh creates keys
*sudoers.sh removes tty from sudoers file
*requirements.sh installs requirements


Thanks if you have improvments they are deeply appreciated.
