###My Linux toolbox

### CENTOS scripts are in centos folder and DEBIAN folders are in Debian folder

This is meant to be my own linux toolbox to be used to automate with Ansible later.

I will try to get it to be more complete later on. 



Thank you.

If you have improvments they are deeply appreciated.
